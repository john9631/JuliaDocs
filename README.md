**NBViewer IJulia Notebooks**   
[Gadfly Tutorial IJulia Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/john9631/JuliaDocs/master/Gadfly Tutorial.ipynb)
 


Because NBViewer doesn't display D3 plots I have also uploaded the 
[Gadfly  
Tutorial as HTML](http://john9631.co.nf/GadflyTutorial.html).  The NBViewer provides a link to download the notebook  
if you wish to run it yourself or modify it.
